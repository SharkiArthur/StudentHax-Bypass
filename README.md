Go-Guardian Bypass is a Chrome extension that allows students to disable the GoGuardian web filtering system on their school-issued devices. GoGuardian is a popular web filtering system used by many schools to block access to certain websites and online resources that may be deemed inappropriate or distracting for students.

With this extension, students can disable GoGuardian on any webpage they visit, allowing them to access restricted websites and resources that may be necessary for their studies. The extension works by injecting a JavaScript script that disables the GoGuardian functions into every webpage the student visits.

To use the extension, Once logged in, they can click on the extension icon in their browser and select "Disable GoGuardian" to turn off the filtering system. The extension also includes a "Logged In" page that confirms that the student has successfully logged in and can now disable GoGuardian.
